**A purpose-built web app for church small groups — replacing Facebook groups with a warm, simple community platform.**

Small Group Hub was originally built for the **Incouragers** Sunday small group class at **First Redeemer Church** — a group of ~150 members who needed a better home than Facebook. Designed for all ages and comfortable on any device, it gives your group a dedicated space for events, announcements, lectures, and community — without the noise of social media.

It's open source and fully configurable, so any small group or church class can fork it, swap in their name and colors, and have it running in under an hour.

## Origin Story

The Incouragers class at First Redeemer Church needed a simple, welcoming space to replace their Facebook group. Members ranged widely in age and tech comfort — so everything had to be large, readable, and dead-simple to use. No cluttered feeds. No distracting algorithms. Just the group, their events, and their faith.

Small Group Hub was built to solve exactly that. It has since been open-sourced so other groups can benefit from the same foundation.

## Why Small Group Hub?

- **Simplicity** — Easy to navigate for all ages, no distracting social media noise
- **Warmth** — Large fonts, readable text, and an inviting design that welcomes everyone
- **Affordability** — Runs for ~$10–15/year (domain name only — everything else is free)
- **Privacy** — Your community's data stays yours, not a tech company's
- **Customizable** — Fork it and brand it as your own with a single config file change

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account (free)
- A [Resend](https://resend.com) account (free)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codyhinz/incouragers.git
   cd incouragers
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Open the **SQL Editor** and run the migrations in order:
     1. `supabase/migrations/001_schema.sql`
     2. `supabase/migrations/002_rls.sql`
   - Find your keys at **Settings → API**

3. **Configure authentication redirect URLs**
   - In Supabase: **Authentication → URL Configuration**
   - Set **Site URL** to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Add to **Redirect URLs**:
     - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
     - `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback` (add when deploying)

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Fill in `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_...
   SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=sb_secret_...
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Bootstrap Your First Admin

Since there are no admins yet, you need to manually promote the first one:

1. Go to **Supabase → Authentication → Users → Invite user** and invite your email
2. Click the magic link in the email to sign in
3. In **Table Editor → profiles**, find your row and change `role` to `admin`
4. Refresh — you'll now have access to the Admin Panel at `/admin`

---

## Customizing for Your Group

All group-specific branding lives in one file — `lib/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Your Group Name",
  description: "A welcoming community of faith, growing together in God's Word.",
  tagline: "Encouraging one another daily",
  url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
  email: {
    from: "Your Group <noreply@yourgroup.org>",
  },
} as const;
```

Change `name` and you're done. Colors can be adjusted in `app/globals.css`. Everything else — events, announcements, donation links — is managed through the admin panel at runtime.
